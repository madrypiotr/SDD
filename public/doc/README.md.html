<p><strong>This system is designed to make it possible for everyone in the community to influence it. The principle of equal access to the conclusion, reconciliation and vote of ideas, proposals and projects is equal. There will be no admin system that can arbitrarily change anything, correct parameters, add users, restrict their rights, or delete. Any individual parameters and global settings, mode or mode of operation of the System are determined only by decision of all members. This procedure applies both to the startup of the System configuration and to changes made during further use.</strong></p>

Important but simple - in SDD the basic objects are Issues (added by users). Then the issues pass the Deliberation / Voting / Execution path. The above listed operations will be implemented in five main panels (see illustration).

<td>Here you will get every idea, proposal, problem to solve. <strong>We call it the Issue</strong>. <br />It has many statuses. On startup it is set to active as &quot;deliberate&quot;. Issues receive priority points from users (-5 to +5). They are on the list arranged according to the values of the sum of priorities. Issues with the highest priority go to the next panel - Voting. <br /> <strong>But priority, it's not just one condition</strong>. Conditions are three. In addition to the priority, three more people need care for the issue (Implementation Team), and the appropriate quorum (in accordance with the organization's regulations). The Issues remain here until they reach the required conditions for Voting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="https://github.com/madrypiotr/SDD/blob/master/client/stylesheets/panel_voting.jpg" alt=""> <strong>KWESTIA_STATUS.GLOSOWANA</strong></td>
<td>The Issues that have entered here will be voted for by the time set in the system's global parameters. At this time there is no deliberation, only vote. Hence, Issues can land in three places: <br /> <strong>1</strong>. in the Trash, if the Issue does not get a positive sum of the parameter, <br /> <strong>2</strong>. in Hibernation, if there were Issue-Option, but did not win the Voting, <br /> <strong>3</strong>. in Implementation (next panel), if she won the Voting.</td>

<td>The panel Implementation is divided into two subpanels: Realized and Executed. <br /> a. <strong>Realized.</strong> The Issues are being implemented as long as their priority is positive. The Issue may also be thrown into the trash bin by a user decision. <br /> b. <strong>Executed.</strong> The Issue may be decided by the users considered completed. Then lands in this panel.</td>

<td>The panel Archives is divided into two subpanels: Thrash bin and Hibernating. <br /> a. <strong>Thrash bin.</strong> Here are the issues that were thrown out by the users decision. Also, those Issues that did not work well in the implementation, that is - their priority dropped below zero - fall into the Trash. <br /> b. <strong>Hibernating.</strong> In the Hibernate panel are placed specific issues. They jump right here from Deliberation. When out of many Question-Options, one of them wins the vote - the other is being put into Hibernation. It is obvious that only one of the Options can be implemented. Only if this winning issue has been withdrawn from implementation - The hibernated Issues are defrosted and return to Deliberation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="https://github.com/madrypiotr/SDD/blob/master/client/stylesheets/panel_set.jpg" alt=""> <strong>KWESTIA_STATUS.ADMINISTROWANA</strong></td>
